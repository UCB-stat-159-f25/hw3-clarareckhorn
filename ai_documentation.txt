input: 

is this enough for my init file """ ligotools package """ __version__ = "0.0.1" from .readligo import *

output: 

That’s a great start, but not quite enough — here’s why 👇

Right now your __init__.py only imports from readligo, so when you try to do

from ligotools.utils import whiten


Python doesn’t “see” the utils submodule, because you never told it to expose that file as part of the package.

✅ Here’s how to fix it

Replace your current __init__.py with this:

"""
ligotools package
"""

__version__ = "0.0.1"

from . import readligo
from . import utils


That’s enough for this import to work properly:

from ligotools.utils import whiten

i have a document 
hw3-clarareckhorn/ligotools/ligotools/utils.py that has my functions that im trying to use but its giving an error

output:

Ah, classic Python import issue — this happens when your ligotools package isn’t being recognized as an installable or importable module from your current working directory. Let’s go step by step to fix it.

✅ Step 1: Check your folder structure

Make sure it looks like this:

hw3-clarareckhorn/
│
├── ligotools/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── readligo.py
│   ├── utils.py
│   └── other files...
│
└── notebook_or_script.ipynb


⚠️ The __init__.py file is essential — it tells Python this folder is a package.
If it’s missing, create an empty file called __init__.py inside ligotools/.

✅ Step 2: Check where you are running the notebook/script from

In your notebook, run:

import os
print(os.getcwd())


This shows your current working directory.
If it’s not the same folder that contains ligotools/, Python won’t find it.

You can fix that by adding the parent folder to the Python path:

import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/hw3-clarareckhorn')


For example, if your notebook is inside hw3-clarareckhorn/, use:

sys.path.append('.')

✅ Step 3: Try importing again

After you’ve ensured both the path and __init__.py file are in place, try again:

from ligotools.utils import whiten, write_wavfile, reqshift, plot_matched_filter_time_series, plot_psd_and_template

✅ Step 4: (Optional but best practice)

If you plan to use it across multiple notebooks or scripts, install your package in editable mode:

cd hw3-clarareckhorn
pip install -e .


This makes ligotools importable from anywhere on your system.

If you want, you can paste your folder structure (with file names) here, and I’ll tell you exactly what to fix.
